:: Other ways of writing Redux
Martin Liberg, M car sharing

@M they don't use createSlice function. instead they write reducers and actions themselves as plain functions.

:: See: redux-toolkit.js and redux-vanilla.js
example 1 is showing what's different between @reduxjs/toolkit and vanilla redux.

Actions are just plain javascript objects
+
Reducers are just plain javascript functions which take these actions to update State.

:: Vanilla Redux
see redux.js

It's good to be aware of and know how to write actions and reducers in vanilla Redux even though we have @reduxjs/toolkit which makes the code less verbose.

Idea: rewrite an old project using vanilla Redux. this excercise will likely help increase understanding of what's happening under the hood.
